# 0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests
<p>Unit tests focus on testing individual units of code, such as functions or methods, in isolation to verify that they produce the expected output.
Integration tests, on the other hand, test how different units of code work together to ensure that the system functions correctly as a whole.
By writing comprehensive tests, we can catch bugs and issues early in the development process, making it easier to maintain and enhance our codebase.
Python provides a powerful testing framework called unittest, which allows us to write and run tests efficiently.</p>
